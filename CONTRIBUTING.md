## Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`):
   - Test individual functions and classes
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Aim for 95%+ coverage

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`):
   - Test component interactions
   - Use real services where appropriate
   - Focus on critical workflows

3. **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`):
   - Test complete user scenarios
   - Use the CLI as users would
   - Validate final outputs

4. **Security Tests** (`tests/unit/security.test.js`):
   - Test input validation and sanitization
   - Verify encryption and authentication
   - Validate network security measures

5. **Performance Tests** (`tests/performance/`):
   - Measure execution time and memory usage
   - Validate performance under load
   - Ensure optimization effectiveness

### Writing Tests

#### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('Component Name', () => {
  let component;
  let mockDependency;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
    mockDependency = jest.fn();
    component = new Component(mockDependency);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup code
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('method name', () => {
    test('should handle normal case', () => {
      // Test implementation
      const result = component.method('input');
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });

    test('should handle edge case', () => {
      // Edge case testing
      expect(() => component.method(null)).toThrow('Expected error');
    });
  });
});
```

#### Security Test Example

```javascript
describe('Input Validation', () => {
  test('should prevent SQL injection', () => {
    const maliciousInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --";
    expect(() => validator.validate(maliciousInput, 'text'))
      .toThrow('Invalid input detected');
  });

  test('should sanitize XSS attempts', () => {
    const xssInput = '<script>alert("xss")</script>';
    const sanitized = validator.sanitize(xssInput, 'html');
    expect(sanitized).not.toContain('<script>');
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 95% line coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: 85% feature coverage
- **Security Tests**: 100% security function coverage
- **Overall**: 85% total coverage

## Security Guidelines

Security is paramount in this project. All contributors must follow these guidelines:

### Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Use proper authentication mechanisms
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authorization checks
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
6. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly

### Security Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code, ensure:

- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted
- [ ] Authentication is implemented correctly
- [ ] Authorization checks are in place
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security tests are included and passing

### Reporting Security Issues

**Never create public issues for security vulnerabilities.** Report them privately to [security@mdsaad-cli.com](mailto:security@mdsaad-cli.com).

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc for function and class documentation
- Include parameter types and return values
- Provide examples for complex functions
- Document security considerations

```javascript
/**
 * Validates user input against specified type with security checks
 * @param {string} input - The input to validate
 * @param {string} type - Validation type (email, url, etc.)
 * @param {Object} [options={}] - Optional validation configuration
 * @returns {string} Validated and sanitized input
 * @throws {ValidationError} When input fails validation
 * @example
 * const email = validator.validate('user@example.com', 'email');
 * @security Prevents XSS, SQL injection, and path traversal attacks
 */
function validate(input, type, options = {}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### README Updates

When adding new features:

1. Update the feature list
2. Add usage examples
3. Update installation instructions if needed
4. Include any new configuration options

### API Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include request/response examples
- Document error conditions
- Provide integration examples

## Style Guide

### JavaScript Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code style enforcement. Key guidelines:

- Use `const` for immutable values, `let` for mutable values
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Use destructuring where appropriate
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
