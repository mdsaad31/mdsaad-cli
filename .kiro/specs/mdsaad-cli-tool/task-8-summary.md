### Provider Support Matrix
| Provider   | Status      | Streaming | Models              | Rate Limit    |
|------------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Gemini     | API         | No        | gemini-pro          | 60 req/min    |
| OpenRouter | API         | Yes       | GPT-4, Claude, etc. | 100 req/min   |
| DeepSeek   | API         | Yes       | deepseek-chat/coder | 50 req/min    |
| Groq       | API         | Yes       | Llama3, Mixtral     | Default       |
| Nvidia     | API         | Yes       | Llama3-70B, Phi-3   | Default       |
| Ollama     | Local       | No        | User-installed      | No limit      |

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues with graceful degradation
- API key validation with helpful setup guidance
- Rate limit exceeded with reset time display
- Provider unavailability with automatic failover
- Model not found with available model suggestions

### Testing Coverage (42 tests)
- ✅ Basic functionality and validation
- ✅ Special commands (help, providers, models, etc.)
- ✅ Provider selection and fallback logic
- ✅ Request formatting for all provider types
- ✅ Response parsing with error conditions
- ✅ Rate limiting and quota management
- ✅ Conversation history management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Simple AI query
mdsaad ai "What is machine learning?"

# With specific provider
mdsaad ai "Write a Python function" --provider deepseek

# With context from recent conversation
mdsaad ai "Explain more about that" --context recent

# Interactive chat mode
mdsaad ai interactive
```

### Provider Management
```bash
# Show all providers and their status
mdsaad ai providers

# Show available models
mdsaad ai models

# Check Ollama status and install models
mdsaad ai ollama
mdsaad ai pull --model llama3.2
```

### Conversation Management
```bash
# View conversation history
mdsaad ai history

# Check rate limit usage
mdsaad ai quota

# Clear conversation history
mdsaad ai clear
```

## Integration Benefits
